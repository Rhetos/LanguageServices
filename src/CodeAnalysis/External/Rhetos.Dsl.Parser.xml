            NOTES:
            1. Parsing is done in the order as the properties are declares in the source.
            2. It is possible to nest a concept within a parent concept ("module x { entity y; }") or to use it explicitly ("entity x.y;").
            Parent reference is defined by a property that references another concept, marked with <see cref="T:Rhetos.Dsl.ConceptParentAttribute"/> or the first property by default.
            Derived concept can override parent property with its own property marked with <see cref="T:Rhetos.Dsl.ConceptParentAttribute"/>;
            this allows construction of recursive concepts such as menu items.
            3. If the parent property type is ConceptSyntaxNode interface, not the implementation, it can reference any concept
            but can only be used in the nested form.
            4. Recursive "parent" property (referencing the same concept type), marked with <see cref="T:Rhetos.Dsl.ConceptParentAttribute"/>
            does not have to be the first property to be used in the nested form.
